## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Examine the Template Structure
```bash
test/
├── Maze.h          # Class declarations with TODOs
├── Maze.cpp        # Implementation templates with guidance
├── main.cpp        # User interface and demo functions
├── Makefile        # Build system with explanations
├── README.md       # This file
├── obj/            # Object files (created during build)
└── bin/            # Executable files (created during build)
```

### 2. Read the TODOs
Start by reading through all the TODO comments in:
- `Maze.h` - Understand the class design
- `Maze.cpp` - See the implementation structure
- `main.cpp` - Learn about the user interface

### 3. Implement Step by Step
Don't try to implement everything at once! Follow this order:

```cpp
// 1. Start with basic structures (Maze.h)
struct Cell { /* ... */ };
enum Direction { /* ... */ };

// 2. Implement constructors (Maze.cpp)
Maze::Maze() { /* ... */ }

// 3. Add helper methods
Cell* getCell(int x, int y) { /* ... */ }

// 4. Implement core algorithm
void generateMazeIterative() { /* ... */ }
```

### 4. Test Frequently
After each implementation step:
```bash
make                    # Build the project
make run               # Test your implementation
make debug             # Build with debugging info
```

## 🧠 Algorithm Understanding

### Maze Representation
```
Each cell has 4 walls: TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT
Removing a wall connects two adjacent cells
Goal: Connect all cells with exactly one path between any two cells
```

### Iterative Algorithm (Stack-Based)
```
1. Start with all walls present
2. Choose starting cell, mark as visited
3. Push to stack
4. While stack not empty:
   - Get current cell from stack top
   - Find unvisited neighbors
   - If neighbors exist:
     * Choose random neighbor
     * Remove wall between current and neighbor
     * Mark neighbor as visited
     * Push neighbor to stack
   - If no neighbors: pop from stack (backtrack)
```

### Recursive Algorithm
```
1. Mark current cell as visited
2. Get all unvisited neighbors
3. For each unvisited neighbor:
   - Remove wall to neighbor
   - Recursively call algorithm on neighbor
```

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Compilation Errors:**
```bash
# Missing includes
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

# Undefined references - check if methods are declared and defined
# Syntax errors - check semicolons, braces, spelling
```

**Logic Errors:**
```cpp
// Wrong coordinates - remember grid[y][x] not grid[x][y]
// Forgetting to remove walls from both cells
// Not marking cells as visited
// Off-by-one errors in bounds checking
```

**Runtime Errors:**
```cpp
// Null pointer access - always check getCell() return value
// Stack overflow - use iterative for large mazes
// Infinite loops - ensure termination conditions
```

### Testing Strategies
```cpp
// Test with tiny mazes first (3x3)
// Print coordinates and wall states for debugging
// Verify neighbor detection works correctly
// Check that walls are removed from both cells
// Test boundary conditions
```

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Algorithm Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = width × height
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for grid + O(n) for stack/recursion

### Typical Performance (for reference)
```
10x10 maze:   ~100-500 microseconds
20x20 maze:   ~500-2000 microseconds
30x30 maze:   ~1000-5000 microseconds
40x40 maze:   ~2000-10000 microseconds
```

### Comparison: Iterative vs Recursive
- Iterative: Usually faster, more memory efficient
- Recursive: More elegant, easier to understand
- Both produce equivalent results with same seed

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: My maze has isolated sections**
A: Check that you're removing walls from both cells when connecting them

**Q: Program crashes with large mazes**

**Q: Walls don't line up properly**
A: Verify your coordinate system and wall indexing (TOP=0, RIGHT=1, BOTTOM=2, LEFT=3)

**Q: Random generation isn't working**
A: Make sure you're seeding the random number generator properly
